# Homebrew GUI

This is a revived version of the homebrew-gui repo, since cask does not have the ability to build from source.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install homebrew/gui/<formula>`

Or `brew tap homebrew/gui` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-gui/master/<formula>.rb
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/README.md).
